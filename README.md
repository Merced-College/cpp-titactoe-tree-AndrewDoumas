# cpp_tictactoe_tree



The purpose of the minimax function is to deterine what the best and worst plays for the AI are.

The GameState class is like a tree, because when it creates a child state it is similar to creating a new node in a tree structure.

The recursion stops for the minimax algorithm after it explores all the possible plays that could be made and selects the best move from that.
